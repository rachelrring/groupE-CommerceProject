# Group Project

This E-commerce website was created by myself, and two other students in my course. We worked as a team and split the work evenly, using git to keep track of our progress and changes.

Requirements for the project:
- User Friendly Layout and Page design
- Use of Bootstrap5 and external CSS files
- A user can:
  - Sign up
  - Sign in
  - Sign out
  - add items to a cart
  - make payments through stripe
- Use of JSON for database population
